        <p>
          Players in their turns can roll the number of times they want the
          dice, and every time they roll, the numbers drawn are added up.
          However, if the number drawn is 1 (one), the values ​​are immediately
          reset to zero and the player loses his turn. But before the number
          drawn is 1 (one), the player in turn can choose to keep the sum of the
          numbers drawn so far and add them to the total value he has, thus
          losing his turn. For example: Player A currently has 0 Total points
          and on his turn, he rolled 3, 5 and 2 on the dice and before he could
          be unlucky to roll 1, he decided to stop. So adding (3+5+2) to the
          total. Then starting to have 10 points. Upon returning to his turn,
          player A, rolled 5 and decided to stop again, thus adding: Total
          Points = 10 + 5. The player who reaches 100 or more first is the
          winner.
